# DCO bench controller

Control the DCO board from Linux over one USB cable, with no Input board and no Screen
attached.

Parameters go out over the board's USB serial port. **Notes do not go through this tool** —
the DCO already enumerates as a USB MIDI device called `DCO3-MONO`, so play it from a MIDI
keyboard, VMPK, or anything else that can reach an ALSA MIDI port.

---

## 1. Firmware requirement

The board must be built with `ENABLE_USB_CONTROL`, which is on by default in
[`DCO.ino`](../../DCO.ino). It makes the USB serial port accept the same frames
the Input board sends on its UART, using the same handler table, so nothing about the
board's behaviour changes — it just gains a second place those frames can arrive from.

The sketch also needs the TinyUSB stack, which it already required for USB MIDI. From the
DCO sketch folder (the parent of `tools/`):

```bash
arduino-cli compile --fqbn rp2040:rp2040:rpipico2:usbstack=tinyusb \
  --libraries _build_libs .
```

Without `usbstack=tinyusb` the build fails with
`#error TinyUSB is not selected, please select it in "Tools->Menu->USB Stack"`.

Leave `ENABLE_USB_CONTROL` commented out for production. While it is on, any stray
`a`-`f`, `p`, `w` or `q` byte typed into a serial terminal is read as a frame header.

## 2. Install

`tkinter` ships with Python. Only `pyserial` is extra:

```bash
sudo pacman -S python-pyserial      # Arch / CachyOS
# or, in a virtualenv:
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Run

```bash
python3 app.py                      # auto-detects the DCO3-MONO port
python3 app.py --port /dev/ttyACM0  # or name it explicitly
python3 app.py --theme light        # dark is the default
```

Pick the port and press **Connect**. The tool **automatically pushes the sound patch**
with **Send all** (same set as presets: no Calibration, Diagnostics, or bench/debug).
Loading / Prev / Next / Init while connected also push that patch only. Use **Send all**
anytime to resync the patch after a board reset.

When connected, patch sliders/combos/checks send live on change (coalesced ~20 ms).
**Calibration**, **Diagnostics**, and **bench** controls are not stored and are sent
**only on manual use** (move a cal control, click a diag/bench button, drag PIO pulse).

### Preset bank

A classic **128-slot** program bar sits under the connection toolbar:

`[ < ]  [ 000 ]  [ name ]  [ > ]  [ Load ]  [ Save ]  [ Save as… ]  [ Init ]`

| Control | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| **Prev / Next** / program number | Select slot **0–127** and load it immediately (empty slots load Init defaults) |
| **Load** | Reload the current slot from disk, discarding unsaved edits |
| **Save** | Store the current UI into the current slot (keeps the name) |
| **Save as…** | Prompt for a name, then save into the current slot |
| **Init** | Set patch controls to `params.py` defaults (slot number unchanged); mark dirty until Save |

A leading `*` beside the name means the UI differs from the last loaded or saved snapshot.
The bank lives in [`presets/bank.json`](presets/bank.json). Slot 0 ships as **Init**; the rest
are empty until you save into them. Calibration, Diagnostics, and bench controls are not
stored and are not part of Connect / preset / **Send all** — only the sound patch is.

### If the port will not open

- **Permissions.** You need to be in the group that owns `/dev/ttyACM*` — `uucp` on Arch
  and CachyOS, `dialout` on Debian and Ubuntu. Check with `ls -l /dev/ttyACM0`, then
  `sudo usermod -aG uucp $USER` and log out and back in.
- **ModemManager.** It probes new ACM devices on connect and can hold the port for a few
  seconds or grab it outright. If it is the culprit, `systemctl stop ModemManager`, or
  add a udev rule with `ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE="1"` for the board's USB IDs.
- **No `/dev/ttyACM*` at all.** The board is not running a TinyUSB build, or it is in
  BOOTSEL mode. Re-flash with the `usbstack=tinyusb` FQBN above.

## 4. Layout

Parameter tabs from the tables in [`params.py`](params.py), plus Diagnostics for
bench-only buttons:

| Tab | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| Oscillators | Pitch/Sync left, Voice & drift right; levels and wave matrix full-width at the bottom |
| Envelopes | Three vertical ADSR time columns side by side; curve params as spinboxes; routing and rest below |
| Filter | Cutoff, resonance, envelope and LFO amounts, keytrack, distortion Drive/Mix |
| PWM | Pulse width, LFO2 and envelope to PW |
| LFOs | Waveforms, speeds, and the LFO routing depths |
| Calibration | Autotune trigger, manual calibration stage/offsets, PIO pulse length (Y) via debug 160, fake-cal seed |
| Character | Master Character amount (ParamId 221) plus diagnostic noise jitters via debug 160 (`0xC8` / `0xCA` / `0xCB`); see [`docs/CHARACTER.md`](../../docs/CHARACTER.md) |
| Diagnostics | PIO topology / period probes and hot-path profiler buttons |

Anything the board prints — the topology report, profiler tables, `DCO_DEBUG_REPORT`
output, autotune progress — lands in the **Board output** pane under the tabs. Drag the
sash between the notebook and that pane to give the dump more room; there is a horizontal
scrollbar for wide profiler lines. Lines this tool writes itself are prefixed `[link]`,
`[send]` or `[ui]` and tinted, so they are easy to tell from the board's own output.

### Appearance

Dark by default. The **Light** / **Dark** button in the toolbar switches in place, and
`--theme light` starts that way; the choice is not remembered between runs, so use a shell
alias if you always want light.

The colours are painted onto ttk's built-in `clam` theme, which means **no extra package is
needed**. If [`sv-ttk`](https://pypi.org/project/sv-ttk/) happens to be installed it is used
instead for a more modern look and real toggle switches on the boolean parameters:

```bash
pip install sv-ttk        # entirely optional, detected automatically
```

Everything lives in [`theme.py`](theme.py). Note that ttk styling only reaches ttk widgets,
so that module also recolours the plain-Tk parts by hand — each tab's scroll canvas, the log
pane, the tooltips and the combobox dropdown — reading the colours back out of the live
style so the same code works under either backend.

## 5. Testing the PIO sync work

The **Oscillators** tab (Sync section) is the reason this tool exists. `PARAM_SOFT_SYNC` (36)
(0 = hard, 1..3 = soft-sync thresholds) and `PARAM_SUBOSC_DIVIDE` (37) have no Input-board UI
at all, so the panel cannot reach them; this is the only way to exercise them. See
[`DCO/docs/PIO_OSCILLATORS.md`](../../docs/PIO_OSCILLATORS.md) for what they do.

On the **Diagnostics** tab, the three PIO buttons call the bench helpers documented in
section 12 of that file, which nothing else in the firmware invokes:

- **PIO topology report** verifies every oscillator reset pin still reads back as PIO0.
  Expect the summary line `reset pin ownership: OK (all PIO0)`. Anything else means a pin
  has been stolen and hard sync cannot work, whatever it sounds like. This also doubles as
  an end-to-end link test: press it, see text come back.
- **Period probe** parks OSC1 at a fixed divider and prints the predicted period, to
  compare against a frequency counter on the reset pin. Run both probes and feed the two
  readings to `pio_solve_period_model()` to confirm the weight and overhead constants.
  **Only works with no note playing** — `voice_task_main()` pushes a fresh divider every frame
  for a held note, which immediately overwrites what the probe set.

On the same tab, the **Hot-path profiler** buttons drive `PARAM_DEBUG_COMMAND` values
10 / 11 / 12. They only do anything when the firmware is built with `RUNNING_AVERAGE`; see
[`DCO/docs/BENCHMARKING.md`](../../docs/BENCHMARKING.md).

- **Dump profiler once** asks both cores for a snapshot; core 0 prints the budget table
  into the Board output pane a moment later.
- **Reset profiler** clears every accumulator.
- **Toggle ~1 Hz dump** turns the automatic report on or off; the board immediately prints
  `bench periodic on` or `off`.

Two controls on the Oscillators tab (Sync section) are easy to mistake for each other, because they are different
parameters doing different jobs:

- **Hard sync topology** (31) routes one oscillator's sideset onto another's reset pin, so
  the slave is forced to the master's period for the whole note.
- **Osc sync / phase align OSC2** (17) decides what happens at *note-on*. **Off** leaves the
  oscillators running through the note, so their phase relationship is whatever it happens to
  be. **Sync at note-on** stops OSC1 and OSC2 and restarts them together on one cycle. The
  degree entries do the same restart and delay OSC2's first flyback (one-shot X countdown to
  `loop_final`; later cycles keep a normal pulse). Needs EXACT_Y retrig (default). Note that
  free running also skips the exact-period rewrite, so it tunes very slightly differently —
  see section 8 of [`PIO_OSCILLATORS.md`](../../docs/PIO_OSCILLATORS.md).

For the hard-sync listening check: set **Hard sync topology** to 1 or 2, leave **Soft sync**
off, hold a note, and sweep the slave's detune. A timbral formant sweep means sync is working.
If the pitch simply tracks with no change in character, the slave is being cloned rather
than synced.

To hear the note-on sync on its own, leave the topology at 0, set **Osc sync / phase align
OSC2** to **Sync at note-on**, and retrigger the same note repeatedly: the attack transient
becomes identical every time, where at **Off** it varies from note to note.

## 6. The same controls over MIDI CC

This tool talks to the board over USB serial, which needs `ENABLE_USB_CONTROL` and a cable
to this machine. For everything else — a DAW, a tablet, a hardware controller — the same
control surface is also mapped onto 7-bit MIDI CC, listed in
[`DCO/docs/MIDI_CC_MAP.md`](../../docs/MIDI_CC_MAP.md).

`gen_midi_map.py` generates that chart, the firmware's `midi_cc_map.h` and a ready-made
[Open Stage Control](https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net/) session from the same `params.py`
tables the GUI is built from, so the four cannot drift apart:

```bash
python3 gen_midi_map.py            # rewrite the three generated files
python3 gen_midi_map.py --check    # fail if they are out of date
```

To use the panel, install `open-stage-control` (AUR, a `.deb`, or the release zip) and
point it at the board's MIDI port:

```bash
open-stage-control --theme nord \
                   --midi "dco3:DCO3-MONO,DCO3-MONO" \
                   --load ../panels/dco3_panel.json
```

The `dco3` name in that string is what the session's widgets target, so keep it. `--theme`
is optional; `nord` and `orange` are the two built in.

One tab per group, one knob per controller, grouped under the block they belong to. The
number under each knob is the value the DCO will actually hold — `0..4095` for cutoff, the
exp-mapped `0..25000` for envelope times — not the controller number, computed by the same
formula as the chart. Double-tapping a knob returns it to its `params.py` default, which is
also where every knob starts.

As with this tool, the board boots with its own defaults and never reports back, so push
the panel's state once after connecting: **State -> Send All** in the client menu.

Autotune and "store manual cal offsets" are deliberately left off the CC map, since one is
a minute-long takeover of the board and the other writes the filesystem. Those stay here.

## 7. Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| [`protocol.py`](protocol.py) | Frame builders, the envelope lin-to-exp curve, port detection |
| [`params.py`](params.py) | The whole control surface as data; edit this to add a control |
| [`presets.py`](presets.py) | 128-slot bank load/save, capture/apply of patch parameters |
| [`presets/bank.json`](presets/bank.json) | Default program bank (slot 0 = Init); edit locally via the UI |
| [`app.py`](app.py) | tkinter UI generated from `params.py` |
| [`theme.py`](theme.py) | Dark and light palettes, ttk styling, plain-Tk recolouring |
| [`gen_midi_map.py`](gen_midi_map.py) | Emits the CC map, its chart and the panel session from `params.py` |

### Adding a parameter

Add the ID to [`DCO/params_def.h`](../../params_def.h) and an `apply_param_*` entry to
`paramTable[]` in [`DCO/params.ino`](../../params.ino) as usual, then add one `Param`
row to `params.py`. The UI picks it up with no changes to `app.py`. To give it a CC as
well, put a free controller number in the row's `cc=` field and re-run `gen_midi_map.py`;
it refuses to run on a collision or a reserved controller.

## 8. Protocol notes

Frames are exactly what the Input board sends, per
[`DCO/serial_input_protocol.h`](../../serial_input_protocol.h): one command byte, then
a fixed-length big-endian payload. `'p'` and `'w'` end in a finish byte of 1; the `'a'`-`'f'`
block frames do not.

Two details that are easy to get wrong:

- **Everything is sent as `'p'` (16-bit), even parameters the Input board sends as `'w'`.**
  `'w'` carries a signed 8-bit value, so portamento 200 arrives as -56 and only comes out
  right because the apply function casts back through `uint8_t`. A `'p'` frame with the
  true positive value lands on the same result without relying on that round trip.
- **Envelope attack, decay and release are exp-mapped on the wire** (0..25000), while
  sustain is linear (0..4095). `protocol.lin_to_exp()` replicates
  `linearToExponential(v, 50, 25000)` from the Input board so a slider here feels like the
  physical fader. The CC layer in the firmware applies the same curve, for the same reason.
